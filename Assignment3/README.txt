Assignment 3: Pseudo-assembly Code Generation
Members:      Tim, Luis, Stephen

Description: Program defines variables, registers, and types to be
             used to assist in gererating the target code. Input is
	     provided as a tree literal. Variables and values are type-
	     checked. Function codeGen takes an AST (the tree literal)
	     as a parameter and pseudo-assembly code is generated for
	     the specified program.
